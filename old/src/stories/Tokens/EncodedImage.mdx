# Encoded Image

Encoded Image tokens are primarily used to create the dropdown arrow on `<select>` elements using the `.form-control` class.

It is a data-encoded URI SVG which can be set as a background image and then positioned as needed.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Default} />

## Usage

These tokens can be applied as a background image and the width for position.

```css
background: var(--op-encoded-images-dropdown-arrow) center right no-repeat;
```

## Available tokens and their definitions

<DesignTokenDocBlock categoryName="Encoded Images" viewType="card" />
