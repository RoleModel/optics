# Scale Overriding

If you want to change the font or spacing scale within the context of a specific component, you can't just set the `--rm-space-scale-unit` because the css variables for the scale are already computed and won't be re-computed when you set the scale unit. You can force it to re-compute by redefining the scale. This is why each set of tokens is defined in a scss mixin. `card--condensed` is a great example of how to do this.

```scss
.card--condensed {
  @include spacing-scales;
  --rm-space-scale-unit: 0.5rem;
}
```
