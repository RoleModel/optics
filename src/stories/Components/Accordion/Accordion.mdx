# Accordion

Accordion classes are built on the `details` and `summary` html elements. They provide consistent and composable styling for disclosure widgets.

## Playground

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />
<Controls of={AccordionStories.Default} />

### Selective Imports

Accordion can be used as a standalone component, however, it does have a few dependencies. To see a full dependency list, see [Dependency Graph](?path=/docs/overview-selective-imports--docs#dependencies)

```css
// Depends on
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/core/tokens';
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/core/base';
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/components/icon';

// Component
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/components/accordion';
```

## Variations

### Default

`.accordion` used on a `details` element with a `summary` element as the first child will create an accordion component.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

### Label Before Icon

Positioning the arrow icon after the text inside of the summary will result on the icon being on the right side of the accordion.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.LabelBeforeIcon} />

## Overriding styles

The accordion classes are built on a [sass placeholder selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors)

This allows multiple classes to share the same behavior. You can modify all accordion behavior by overriding the `%accordion-global` placeholder selector and setting any properties:

```css
%accordion-global {
}
```

## Custom Accordion

Your application may need a custom accordion. To add one, just follow this template:

```css
.accordion-{name} {
  @extend %accordion-global;

  --_op-accordion-title-height: var(--op-font-small);
}
```
