# Card

Card classes can be used to denote bordered sections of an application. They provide simple styles to create sections or "cards" for your interface. They can also be used as a starting point for "row" or list styles.

## Playground

<Canvas of={CardStories.Plain} />
<Controls of={CardStories.Plain} />

### Selective Imports

Card can be used as a standalone component, however, it does have a few dependencies. To see a full dependency list, see [Dependency Graph](?path=/docs/overview-selective-imports--docs#dependencies)

```css
// Depends on
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/core/tokens';
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/core/base';

// Component
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/components/card';
```

## Variations

## Overriding card styles

The card classes are built on a [sass placeholder selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors)

This allows multiple card classes to share the same behavior. You can modify all cards behavior by overriding the `%card-global` placeholder selector and setting any properties:

```css
%card-global {
  font-size: var(--op-font-2x-large);
}
```

If you need to override the behavior of a particular card style, you can open the respective class and set or change properties

```css
// This will only affect the card, but not card-padded
.card {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
}
```

## Custom Card

Your application may need a custom card. To add one, just follow this template:

```css
.card-{name} {
  @extend %card-global;

  background-color:
  color:
}
```

```css
.card-purple {
  @extend %badge-global;

  border-radius: var(--op-radius-large);
  font-size: var(--op-font-2x-large);

  .card__header {
    background-color: purple;
    color: white;
  }
}
```
