# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs component is used to show the user's current location in a hierarchy of pages.

It can be applied to a `nav` element with a collection of links and separators within it.

## Playground

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Default} />
<Controls of={BreadcrumbsStories.Default} />

### Selective Imports

Breadcrumbs can be used as a standalone component, however, it does have a few dependencies. To see a full dependency list, see [Dependency Graph](?path=/docs/overview-selective-imports--docs#dependencies)

```css
// Depends on
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/core/tokens';
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/core/base';

// Component
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/components/breadcrumbs';
```

## Variations

### Default

`.breadcrumbs` should be used on a `nav` element. Within it, links with `.breadcrumbs__link`, separators with `.breadcrumbs__separator`, and the last item span with `.breadcrumbs__text` should be used.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Default} />

### Size

`.breadcrumbs--small`, `.breadcrumbs--large` (with small being the default) modify the font size of the breadcrumb links and text.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Large} />

### Separator

`.breadcrumbs__separator` is used to separate the links in the breadcrumbs. It is a div that anything can be put within, however typically would be used with an [Icon](?path=/docs/visual-components-icon--docs).

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.SeparatorIcon} />

## Breadcrumb API

Styles are built on css variables scoped to the breadcrumbs.

Here are the variables that can be customized.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```css
--_op-breadcrumbs-font-size-small:
--_op-breadcrumbs-font-size-large:
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Customizing Breadcrumbs styles

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: createAlert({
      title: 'Important!',
      description: 'These patterns represent how to customize the style of the breadcrumbs for your project.',
    }).outerHTML,
  }}
></div>

The breadcrumbs classes are built on a [sass placeholder selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors)

This allows multiple classes to share the same behavior. You can modify all breadcrumbs behavior by overriding the `%breadcrumbs-global` placeholder selector and setting any properties:

```css
%breadcrumbs-global {
  align-items: start;
}
```

If you want to override how the size modifier behaves, you can use API described above to change which font size each size uses.

```css
%btn-global {
  --_op-breadcrumbs-font-size-small: var(--op-font-4x-large);
  --_op-breadcrumbs-font-size-large: var(--op-font-6x-large);
}
```

## New Breadcrumbs Variations

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: createAlert({
      title: 'Important!',
      description: 'These patterns represent how to create new variations of the Breadcrumbs for your project.',
    }).outerHTML,
  }}
></div>

Your application may need a custom breadcrumbs component. To add one, just follow this template:

```css
.breadcrumbs-{name} {
  @extend %breadcrumbs-global;

  background-color:
  color:
}
```
