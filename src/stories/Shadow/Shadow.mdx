# Shadow

Shadow utility classes can be used to add elevation to elements. They provide a simple box shadow style that can be composed with other box shadow variables such as the borders.

## Playground

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='utilities-shadow--default' />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story='^' />
