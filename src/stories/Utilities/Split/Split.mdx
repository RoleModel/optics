The split utility provides a simple way to push two items apart from each other.
It is effectively equivalent to using `.flex .flex-wrap .items-center .justify-between .gap-md` together.
See [Utility Introduction](?path=/docs/utilities-introduction--docs#higher-order-utilities-vs-components) for more information.

See [Utility Layout](?path=/docs/recipes-layout--docs#utility) for an example of how splits
can be used to create more readable flex layouts.

Note: This utility uses the `op` prefix to avoid potential naming conflicts with other CSS frameworks.
This is a pattern we hope to move towards for all utilities in the future.

## Playground

<Canvas of={SplitStories.With} />
<Controls of={SplitStories.With} />

## Without

A normal `div` without the split utility

<Canvas of={SplitStories.Without} />

## Split Property

`.op-split` Creates a flex split.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.With} />

## Align Items Stretch

`.items-stretch` Stretches each item across the cross axis. This is the default alignment and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something set differently.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignStretch} />

## Align Items Start

`.items-start` places each item at the start of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignStart} />

## Align Items Center

`.items-center` places each item at the center of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignCenter} />

## Align Items End

`.items-end` places each item at the end of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignEnd} />

## Align Items Baseline

`.items-baseline` places each item at the text baseline of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignBaseline} />
