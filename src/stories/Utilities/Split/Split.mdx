While flex utilities are great for moving quickly or for simple layouts, they can easily become
cumbersome to manage and tend to turn into "Flex Spaghetti". In some of these cases, reaching
for named components may make sense. However, there are times when a full component is more
restrictive than you need and hurts productivity. Sometimes you need just a bit more structure
to your layout, but not a component. Stacks provide a simple way to create readable,
flexible layouts without the overhead of a full component.

The split utility provides a simple way to push two items apart from each other.
It is effectively equivalent to using `.flex .flex-wrap .items-center .justify-between .gap-md` together.

## Playground

<Canvas of={SplitStories.With} />
<Controls of={SplitStories.With} />

## Without

A normal `div` without the cluster utility

<Canvas of={SplitStories.Without} />

## Cluster Property

`.cluster` Creates a flex cluster.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.With} />

## Align Items Stretch

`.items-stretch` Stretches each item across the cross axis. This is the default alignment and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something set differently.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignStretch} />

## Align Items Start

`.items-start` places each item at the start of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignStart} />

## Align Items Center

`.items-center` places each item at the center of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignCenter} />

## Align Items End

`.items-end` places each item at the end of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignEnd} />

## Align Items Baseline

`.items-baseline` places each item at the text baseline of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={SplitStories.AlignBaseline} />
