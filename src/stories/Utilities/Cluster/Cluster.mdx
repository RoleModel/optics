The cluster utility provides a simple way to create a wrapping, group of spaced items. It
works with all of the gap and other flex utilities. It is effectively equivalent to using
`.flex .flex-wrap .items-center .gap-md` together. See [Utility Introduction](?path=/docs/utilities-introduction--docs#higher-order-utilities-vs-components) for more information.

See [Utility Layout](?path=/docs/recipes-layout--docs#utility) for an example of how clusters
can be used to create more readable flex layouts.

Note: This utility uses the `op` prefix to avoid potential naming conflicts with other CSS frameworks.
This is a pattern we hope to move towards for all utilities in the future.

## Playground

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.With} />
<Controls of={ClusterStories.With} />

## Without

A normal `div` without the cluster utility

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.Without} />

## Cluster Property

`.op-cluster` Creates a flex cluster.

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.With} />

## Align Items Stretch

`.items-stretch` Stretches each item across the cross axis. This is the default alignment and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something set differently.

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.AlignStretch} />

## Align Items Start

`.items-start` places each item at the start of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.AlignStart} />

## Align Items Center

`.items-center` places each item at the center of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.AlignCenter} />

## Align Items End

`.items-end` places each item at the end of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.AlignEnd} />

## Align Items Baseline

`.items-baseline` places each item at the text baseline of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={ClusterStories.AlignBaseline} />
