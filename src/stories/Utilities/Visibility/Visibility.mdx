Use the '.sr-only' class to hide accessibility text that is needed for screenreaders but needs to be hidden from regular users. [Read more here.](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility)

## Playground

<Canvas of={VisibilityStories.Hidden} />
<Controls of={VisibilityStories.Hidden} />

## Visible

If no class is used the text will appear as normal.

<Canvas of={VisibilityStories.Visible} />

## Hidden

Using the `.sr-only` class will visually hide the text but leaves it available to screenreaders.

<Canvas of={VisibilityStories.Hidden} />
