Flex utility classes are used to quickly lay out a page using the flex engine.

[CSS Tricks: A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is an excellent resource in understanding how the flexbox layout engine works

[Flexbox Froggy](https://codepip.com/games/flexbox-froggy/) is another excellent resource for practicing your Flexbox knowledge

Note: the `gap-xxs` utility in these examples is not necessary for the flex utilities to work. It is here to distinguish each item.

## Playground

<Canvas of={FlexStories.With} />
<Controls of={FlexStories.With} />

## Without

A normal `div` without the flex utility

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Without} />

## Flex Property

`.flex` Sets the display property to flex.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.With} />

## Flex Direction Row

`.flex-row` sets the flex axis to row. This is the default direction of a flex container and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something that is set to column.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexRow} />

## Flex Direction Column

`.flex-col` sets the flex axis to column. This will affect all justify and align properties.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexCol} />

## Flex Wrap

`.flex-wrap` Tells the flex container to wrap items if too large.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexWrap} />

## Flex No Wrap

`.flex-no-wrap` Forces the flex container to not wrap items if too large.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexNoWrap} />

## Flex Grow

`.flex-grow-1` can be added to an item within a flex container to force it to take up as much space as is available.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexGrowOne} />

## Justify Content Start

`.justify-start` justifies the contents to the start of the flex axis. This is the default justification of a flex container and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something set differently.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.JustifyStart} />

## Justify Content Center

`.justify-center` justifies the contents to the center of the flex axis.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.JustifyCenter} />

## Justify Content End

`.justify-end` justifies the contents to the end of the flex axis.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.JustifyEnd} />

## Justify Content Between

`.justify-between` justifies the contents to spread evenly across the flex axis with spacing in between each item.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.JustifyBetween} />

## Justify Content Around

`.justify-around` justifies the contents to spread evenly across the flex axis with spacing around each item.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.JustifyAround} />

## Align Items Stretch

`.items-stretch` Stretches each flex item across the cross axis. This is the default alignment and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something set differently.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignStretch} />

## Align Items Start

`.items-start` places each flex item at the start of the cross axis.

<Canvas withToolbar>

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignCenter} />

## Align Items Baseline

`.items-baseline` places each flex item at the text baseline of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignBaseline} />

## Align Self Auto

`.self-auto` changes a specific flex item to inherit its alignment from the container. This is the default alignment and doesn't need to be applied unless you are overriding something set differently.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelfAuto} />

## Align Self Stretch

`.self-stretch` Stretches a specific flex item across the cross axis.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelfStretch} />

## Align Self Start

`.self-start` places a specific flex item at the start of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelfStart} />

## Align Self Center

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelfCenter} />

## Align Self End

`.self-end` places a specific flex item at the end of the cross axis.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelfEnd} />

## Align Self Baseline

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelfBaseline} />
