# Button

Button classes can be used on `button` or `a` html elements. They provide consistent and composable styling that should address most applications basic needs.

<!-- Either use <Stories /> to automatically render each story -->
<!-- Or manually render them with custom descriptions -->

## Default

`.btn` Provides a default outlined black text button. This would be commonly used as a cancel button in a form.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--default' />
</Canvas>

## Primary

`.btn-primary` Provides a filled button using the primary color in your theme. This should be used as the primary action on a screen such as the login button on an account screen or the submit button on a form.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--primary' />
</Canvas>

## Secondary

`.btn-secondary` Provides an outlined button using the primary color in your theme. This should be used as a secondary action on a screen such as the create account button on a login screen.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--secondary' />
</Canvas>

## Delete

`.btn-delete` Provides a filled button using the red danger color. This should be used as a destructive action such as delete.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--delete' />
</Canvas>

## Outline

`.btn--outline` This is a modifier which can be used with all button classes. It provides an outlined button that adapts it's color to all the btn variations.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--outline' />
</Canvas>

## No Border

`.btn--no-border` This is a modifier which can be used with all button classes. It provides a button with no border, but the same sizing and adapts it's color to all the btn variations.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--no-border' />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

`.btn--disabled` Should be used on `a` elements that need to be disabled. `button` elements can use the `disabled` attribute as well as this class. This makes the button opaque and changes the cursor to the `not allowed` icon.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--disabled' />
</Canvas>

## Pill

`.btn--pill` Modifies the shape of any other buttons by adding a radius to the left and right.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--pill' />
</Canvas>

## Icon

`.btn--icon` Modifies the shape of any other button class by adding a full radius to the button. This should only be used with an icon as the button text. You can also combine it with `.btn--no-border` for a borderless icon button.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--icon' />
</Canvas>

## Size

`.btn--small`, `.btn--medium`, `.btn--large` (with medium being the default) modify the size of any other button class by changing the font and height to be smaller or larger.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story id='components-button--size' />
</Canvas>

## Custom Button

Your application may need a custom button (new color, special use, etc.). To add one:
1. Create a class like `.btn-something`
2. Define how it behaves with the outline `.btn-something.btn--outline` and no border `.btn-something.btn--no-border`

The other modifiers will automatically work with it. You can use `.btn-delete` as an example of how this would work.

## Playground

<Primary/>
<ArgsTable of='.' story='^'/>
