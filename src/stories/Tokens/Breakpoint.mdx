# Breakpoint

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: createSourceCodeLink({ link: 'core/tokens/base_tokens.scss' }).outerHTML,
  }}
></div>

Breakpoint tokens are used to define common device sizes for use within media queries or max widths.

They are implemented in two ways. First as CSS custom properties (css variables) and second as SCSS variables.

The CSS variables can be used like any of the other tokens for things requiring calculations or max widths.

The SCSS variables can be used for media queries.

Custom properties (css variables) currently cannot be used in a media query since they get defined in an element scope (`:root` in our case).
Media queries exist at the document level and therefore cannot access custom properties.

[CSS ENV Variables](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-env-1/) aims at addressing this by allowing variables at the global document level.

[SCSS Workaround](https://bholmes.dev/blog/alternative-to-css-variable-media-queries/) is the pattern we follow to achieve this.

## Usage

These tokens can be applied in a media query to create responsive behavior.

```css
.small-area {
  max-width: var(--op-breakpoint-small);
}

@media (width > $breakpoint-medium) {
  background-color: var(--op-color-primary-base);
  color: var(--op-color-primary-on-base);
}
```
