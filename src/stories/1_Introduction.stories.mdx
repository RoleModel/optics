# Welcome to RoleModel Design System

RoleModel Design System is an scss package that provides base styles and components that can be integrated and customized in a variety of projects.

## Installation

### NPM
```sh
npm install @rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system
```

### Yarn
```sh
yarn add @rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system
```

### Import

If you are using webpack to compile, you can add this import to the top of your root level `scss` file.
```scss
@import '@rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system';
```

If you are using a different compiler such as Dart Sass, you may need to reference the scss file directly.
```scss
@import '@rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system/dist/scss/rolemodel-design-system'
```

## Tokens

Tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens`

- All core tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/base_tokens.scss`
- Basic color tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/example_color_tokens.scss`
- Color scale tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/scale_color_tokens.scss`
- Dark mode tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/dark_mode_tokens.scss`

There are also a few component specific tokens that are defined in their respective component file, but those are not indented to be global or used outside of that file.

There is a JSON file in `docs/token_structure.json` that lists all the current tokens in one place and shows how the names indicate organization.

## Theming

RoleModel Design System defines the default theme along with it's dark mode.

If you want to customize your application, you can provide your own theme files that serve as overrides to the existing tokens.

An example implementation your main scss file would look like:

```scss
@import '@rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system';

@import 'stylesheets/theme/my_app_theme';
```

Take a look at `src/theme/rolemodel_theme.scss` for an idea of how to structure your custom theme. It can change the colors, even redefine the luminosity and semantic scales. It generally will look like:

```scss
@mixin color-varieties {
  --rm-color-primary-h: my-new-value;
  --rm-color-primary-s: my-new-value;
  --rm-color-primary-l: my-new-value;
}

@mixin fonts {
  --rm-font-family: 'Noto Sans', 'Noto Serif', sans-serif;
}

:root {
  @include color-varieties;
  @include fonts;
}
```
