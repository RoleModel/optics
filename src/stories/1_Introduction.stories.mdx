# Welcome to Optics, a RoleModel Design System

<h2>V{version}</h2>

[Optics](https://github.com/RoleModel/optics) is an scss package that provides base styles and components that can be integrated and customized in a variety of projects.

## Installation

### NPM

```sh
npm install @rolemodel/optics
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add @rolemodel/optics
```

### Import

If you are using webpack to compile, you can add this import to the top of your root level `scss` file.

```scss
@import '@rolemodel/optics';
```

If you are using a different compiler such as Dart Sass, you may need to reference the scss file directly.

```scss
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/optics';
```
