# Welcome to RoleModel Design System

<h2>V{version}</h2>

RoleModel Design System is an scss package that provides base styles and components that can be integrated and customized in a variety of projects.

## Installation

### NPM

```sh
npm install @rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add @rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system
```

### Import

If you are using webpack to compile, you can add this import to the top of your root level `scss` file.

```scss
@import '@rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system';
```

If you are using a different compiler such as Dart Sass, you may need to reference the scss file directly.

```scss
@import '@rolemodel/rolemodel-design-system/dist/scss/rolemodel-design-system';
```

## Tokens

Tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens`

- All core tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/base_tokens.scss`
- Color scale tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/scale_color_tokens.scss`
- Dark mode tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/dark_mode_tokens.scss`

There are also a few component specific tokens that are defined in their respective component file, but those are not indented to be global or used outside of that file.

There is a JSON file in `docs/token_structure.json` that lists all the current tokens in one place and shows how the names indicate organization.
