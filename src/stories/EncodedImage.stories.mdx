# Encoded Image

Encoded Image tokens are primarily used to create the dropdown arrow on `<select>` elements using the `.form-control` class.

It is a data-encoded URI SVG which can be set as a background image and then positioned as needed.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--default" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

These tokens can be applied as a background image and the width for position.

```css
background: var(--rm-form-dropdown-arrow) center right no-repeat;
```

## Available tokens and their definitions
