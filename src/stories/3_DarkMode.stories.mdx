# Dark Mode

Dark mode is enabled by default and will dynamically flip your semantic tokens to a dark version of it based on your system setting.
If your application does not use or need dark mode, it can be disabled by adding a data attribute to your root `html` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-allow-dark-mode-preference='false'>
  ...
</html>
```
