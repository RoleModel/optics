Optics is an scss package that provides base styles and components that can be integrated and customized in a variety of projects.

## Installation

### NPM

```sh
npm install @rolemodel/optics
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add @rolemodel/optics
```

## Getting Started

### Import

If you are using webpack to compile, you can add this import to the top of your root level `scss` file.

```css
@import '@rolemodel/optics'; # Using webpack to compile
// Or
@import '@rolemodel/optics/dist/scss/optics'; # Using a different compiler such as Dart Sass
```

### Note on Compilers

If you are using a different compiler such as Dart Sass, you will need to reference the scss file directly as shown above.

Optics does not support using the [SassC::Rails](https://github.com/sass/sassc-rails) compiler. SassC::Rails is built on top of [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) which is now deprecated in favor of Dart Sass
