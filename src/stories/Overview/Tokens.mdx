# Tokens

Tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens`

- All core tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/base_tokens.scss`
- Color scale tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/scale_color_tokens.scss`
- Dark mode tokens are defined in `src/core/tokens/dark_mode_tokens.scss`

There are also a few component specific tokens that are defined in their respective component file, but those are not indented to be global or used outside of that file.

There is a JSON file in `docs/token_structure.json` that lists all the current tokens in one place and shows how the names indicate organization.
